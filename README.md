Due to the whole retroengine sigma issue our github will be down temporally. The whole situation is trully shocking. We had no idea they were going to use our free software this way, no request or contact at all. They even denied they were using RetrOrangePi in their customer responses. Not even a mention for the core developers from RetroPie, Armbian, LibRetro/Retroarch, OpenELEC etc. They used other peoples hard work to market their project and make a quick buck.
